# Project Title:
Python Math Quiz Program

# Description:
Developed an interactive math quiz program using Python.
The program tests users on basic arithmetic operations including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
It generates random math problems, evaluates user input, times the completion of the quiz, and provides feedback on their performance.

# Technologies Used:
Python, Random Library, Object-Oriented Programming

# Role:
Designed and implemented the core algorithm to generate random math problems.
Developed functions to evaluate user input and provide immediate feedback.
Implemented scoring, timing, and tracking of user performance throughout the quiz.
Ensured the program handled different difficulty levels for each arithmetic operation.
Conducted thorough testing to ensure accuracy and reliability of the program.

# Challenges and Solutions:

# Challenge:
Balancing the difficulty of the generated math problems. 
# Solution:
Implemented different difficulty levels and ensured a mix of simple and complex problems.

# Challenge:
Accurately timing the completion of the quiz. 
# Solution:
Utilized Python's time module to measure and record the time taken to complete the quiz.
